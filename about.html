                    Implementing adaptive learning Implementing adaptive learning is often a challenging task at higher learning institutions where the students come from diverse backgrounds and disciplines. 
                    In this work, we collected informal learning journals from learners. Using the journals, we trained two machine learning models, an automated topic alignment and a doubt detection model 
                    to identify areas of adjustment required for teaching and students who require additional attention. The models form the baseline for a quiz recommender tool to dynamically generate personalized 
                    quizzes for each learner as practices to reinforce learning.
