                    Canteens is a web-based application that streamlines food ordering, payment 
                    processing, and inventory management for canteens. Users can place orders and 
                    pay online, while administrators can manage menus, track inventory, and generate 
                    reports. The system aims to enhance the dining experience, reduce wait times, and 
                    improve operational efficiency. This application is designed for educational 
                    institutions, offices, and other organizations with canteen facilities. It promotes 
                    convenience, flexibility, and data-driven decision-making. By automating canteen 
                    operations, saves time, reduces errors, and increases customer satisfaction.<br><br>

                    Implementing adaptive learning Implementing adaptive learning is often a challenging task at higher learning institutions where the students come from diverse backgrounds and disciplines. 
                    In this work, we collected informal learning journals from learners. Using the journals, we trained two machine learning models, an automated topic alignment and a doubt detection model 
                    to identify areas of adjustment required for teaching and students who require additional attention. The models form the baseline for a quiz recommender tool to dynamically generate personalized 
                    quizzes for each learner as practices to reinforce learning. Our pilot deployment of our AI-enabled Adaptive Learning System showed that our approach de- livers promising results for 
                    learner-centred teaching and personalized learning. Keywords: Adaptive, Personalized Learning, Learning Analytics, AI in Education.<br><br>
